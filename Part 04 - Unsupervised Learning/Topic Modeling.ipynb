        "Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds some natural groups of items (topics) even when we are unsure of what we are looking for. A document can be a part of multiple topics, like in fuzzy clustering (soft clustering), where each data point belongs to more than one cluster.\n",

              "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",
