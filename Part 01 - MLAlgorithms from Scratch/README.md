## Algorithms Implemented.

- KNN
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means
- AdaBoost
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Installation & Usage.

This project has 3 dependencies.

- `NumPy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms.
- `Scikit-learn` for data generation and testing.
- `Matplotlib` for plotting graphs.

**NOTE**: Only the `NumPy` library is used for all the algorithm implementations. Other libraries help in testing of code and making it easy for us, instead of writing that too from scratch.

You can install dependencies using the following command below!

```sh
# For Linux or MacOS:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# For Windows:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
